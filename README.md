# ML2-FinalProject

In this project, we have analyzed 20 years of S&P 500 data with the aim of predicting volatility. To achieve this, we employed a range of machine learning models, each offering unique approaches to time-series forecasting. The models we utilized include:

- Linear Regression, which serves as a baseline model by assessing linear relationships between features.
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a type of recurrent neural network adept at capturing temporal dependencies and patterns in time-series data.
- Prophet, a model developed by Facebook that is optimized for datasets with strong seasonal effects and historical trends.
- XGBoost, a powerful gradient boosting framework that is known for its performance and speed.

Each model's predictive power was evaluated based on standard metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and the coefficient of determination (R-squared). The comparative analysis of these metrics guided us in determining the most effective model for volatility forecasting in the financial context of the S&P 500 index.
